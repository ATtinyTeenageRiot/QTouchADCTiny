# QTouchADCTiny

New updated library using urban's code. works fine.

the example qTouchADC_urban... is working fine now.

To do:
try to make it compatible accros different boards. Arduino Uno, Micro/leonardo, Attiny.
how to access this different port and deal with the weird numbering of the ADC in the ADMUX of the attiny?

see some inspiration of nice code:
